Finite field is so interesting.

But first what is a field? You could look that up on [Wikipedia](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics)>), there is no value in this blog explaining that.

Perhaps what is more valuable is the **motivation** behind a field!

### A laymen's attempt on motivation behind fields.

You just came back from Japan.

- Japan was clean
- Japan has great public transport
- Japan had great food

You liked it and want to plan for the next vacation.

> - clean <br />
> - has great public transport<br />
> - has great food

Likewise in mathematics, we have different "number systems" (comparable to countries). We would like to preserve some "rules" (comparable to qualities) that makes it nice to work with!

> - additive and multiplicative commutativity <br />
> - are self-contained

#### Addition and multiplication

You know those buy 1 get 1 free bargains?

If addition exists, we can actually do subtraction!

Likewise multiplication and division!

#### Additive and multiplicative inverses exist

To undo an addition, we need an additive inverse!

To undo a multiplication, we need a multiplication inverse!

#### Fields are self contained

When doing addition or multiplication with any numbers, it should not result in us having to use any other number systems
